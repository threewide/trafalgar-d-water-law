# 05-Module

## Description

For the 05-Module project we were to create a work day scheduler that allows users to save events. Bootstrap was used to make a grid that held the time, event and save button in a row. In the javascript a setCurrentDate and setTextAreasFromLocal were implemented to propagate the current date and event fields. I was running out of time so was unable to fully implement the dynamic html and css. There is much room for improvemt in the functionality and style.
